# Abstract

We investigate different approaches to assess the performance of multi-resource (MR) systems. MR systems are networks of processes which convert resource inputs into useful goods and services and include agriculture, factories or even entire economies. For a given set of system outputs, alternative resource inputs are often possible, and so performance measures are needed to determine the best system configuration for a particular goal. For example, manufacturing a car from recycled metals may consume more energy than when using virgin metals, and the different methods therefore will perform differently according to chosen objectives, such as material and energy efficiency. 

We identify several performance measures and define them according to a novel framework, which divides them into two categories: (1) 'black-box' metrics, which can be calculated from a system's aggregate inputs and outputs; and (2) 'grey-box' metrics, which require knowledge of resource conversion processes within a MR system. Metrics in the former category include water consumption and carbon footprint; the latter category includes exergy analysis and ecological network analysis.

Socioeconomic development and resource consumption is focussed in urban areas, therefore making them an important application of our metrics, which can be calculated from urban metabolism data. We calculate eight black-box metrics for fifteen global megacities, and find that performance is poorly correlated between measures. [TODO Fill in this explanation gap.] This suggests that assessments should adopt grey-box approaches and consider flows at the level of individual processes within a city. We present the results and insights from this analysis. Finally we make recommendations on how to improve urban metabolism accounting to assist grey-box metric calculation: firstly by including greater detail on conversion process and resource quality; secondly on making their use accessible to decision makers.
