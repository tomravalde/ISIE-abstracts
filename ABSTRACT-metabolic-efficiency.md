# Abstract

A city meets the needs of its inhabitants by appropriating the earth's natural resources and using networks of processes to convert them into useful goods and services. In this work, we evaluate two different approaches to measuring how well a city performs this resource conversion. To meet any given set of population demands (electricity, water, heating, waste management etc.), a range of possible technologies can be used, which in turn affect the city's overall mix of resource inputs and outputs. (For example, heating demand can be met using fossil fuels, biomass, solar energy or other means.) Thus performance measures should help identify the best of many possible system configurations for any given goal.

We single out several performance measures and divide them into two categories: (i) 'black-box' metrics, which are calculated from the resource inputs and outputs crossing the city's boundaries (e.g. carbon footprint); and (ii) 'grey-box', metrics which are calculated from the resource inputs and outputs of a city's individual resource management processes (e.g. exergy analysis).

Using urban metabolism data from @Kennedy2014, we calculate eight black-box metrics for fifteen global megacities and show that performance is poorly correlated between the metrics. This suggests performance assessments should capture the distinctive details about individual processes, to better understand a city's resource consumption. Thus we apply two grey-box approaches, exergy analysis and ecological network analysis, and discuss the insights they reveal. However, relative to black-box methods, grey-box approaches require more data, and are conceptually more complicated. With this in mind, we make two recommendations: first, urban metabolism accounts should be extended to include more information on the resource conversion processes in a city; and second, tools should be developed so these methods can be easily understood and applied by relevant decision makers.
