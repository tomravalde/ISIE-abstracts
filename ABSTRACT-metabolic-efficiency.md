# Abstract

Planet earth is a system of *multi-resource* (MR) systems: systems which convert mixes of input resources into useful output resources and services (and wastes). Whilst these systems (for example energy conversion, water treatment and refineries) have been at the heart of socioeconomic development, our current levels of resource appropriation pose environmental sustainability challenges. It is therefore important that we can measure resource consumption, which we often do using 'indicators' which quantify environmental or economic performance. 

Of particular interest to assessing MR system consumption within industrial ecology [@Frosch1989] is the *multi-resource trade-off problem* (MRTP): for example, if we replaced a system technology with an alternative, which provides the same output, but using a different input mix, which system is 'optimal' when system A uses 1 kg of water and 100 J of energy, and system B uses 2 kg of water and 50 J of energy?

Urban areas are an important MR system subset, and they face a call to adopt principles of industrial ecology to move from linear to circular resource consumption patterns [@Leduc2013]. Using the 'urban metabolism' framework [@Kennedy2007], we review the literature to describe metrics which can be used to address the MRTP to provide a comprehensive interpretation of 'urban metabolic efficiency'. We categorise the metrics according to (1) whether or not they unify different resources into a single measure; (2) whether they see resources as from economic or biophysical perspectives; (3) how easily they can be calculated from an urban metabolism study; and (4) whether they detail the performance of sub-systems within the MR system. We apply these ideas to urban metabolism data provided by @Kennedy2014 and discuss our findings.
