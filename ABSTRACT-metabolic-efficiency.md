# Abstract

Multi-resource (MR) systems are at the heart of socio-economic development processes.  Such systems convert various input resources into useful outputs; and notable examples include energy conversion supply chains, water treatment processes and refineries. However these processes can create significant environmental sustainability challenges due to resource depletion and non-useful/harmful outputs. It is therefore important that we can measure the efficiency of resource consumption in MR systems, which is often done using 'indicators' which quantify environmental or economic performance. 

Of particular interest to assessing the resource consumption of MR systems within industrial ecology is the *multi-resource trade-off problem* (MRTP).  For example, if we replaced one technology within a system with an alternative, which provides the same output but using a different input mix, which configuration would be 'optimal'? Which system is preferred if technology A uses 1 kg of water and 100 J of energy, and technology B uses 2 kg of water and 50 J of energy, in view of specific contextual challenges?

Urban areas are an important MR system subset, and they face a call to adopt principles of industrial ecology to move from linear to circular resource consumption patterns [@Leduc2013]. Using the 'urban metabolism' framework [@Kennedy2007], we review the literature to describe metrics which can be used to address the MRTP and provide a comprehensive interpretation of 'urban metabolic efficiency'. We categorise the metrics according to (1) whether or not they unify different resources into a single measure; (2) whether they see resources from economic or biophysical perspectives; (3) how easily they can be calculated from an urban metabolism study; and (4) whether they detail the performance of sub-systems within the MR system. We apply these ideas to example urban metabolism data and discuss our findings.
