# Abstract

We investigate how the overall resource consumption and output of a city is affected by the combination of processes it uses to convert natural resources into useful goods and services. Consider the provision of heating: typically fuel is burned and the heat is carried by water to where it is needed. But there are multiple ways to do this: district heating networks generate heat centrally for a large number of homes, whereas more traditional approaches generate heat within an individual home; in both cases, there is a choice of fuels (such as coal, gas or biomass). Thus the mix of processes a city uses to manage its energy, water and waste, will affect the overall resource flows crossing into and out of urban boundaries.

Our methodology has three steps. First we carry out 'horizon scanning', where we systematically search the literature to identify over 300 processes which manage energy, water and waste. Secondly, for each process, we collect data about the quantities of energy, water and waste they consume or produce. We record this data in a database, and then use it to formulate black-box mathematical representations of each process. Thirdly we analyse the different ways the black-box processes can be combined to meet the demands of a city, and how these combinations consequently shape the city's overall metabolism.

This work will help identify the most promising resource management processes for given city types (such as developing or mature) with particular goals in mind (such as minimising water consumption or carbon footprint). Our database also provides planners and policy makers with process performance data, to assist decision making.
