# Abstract

Urban areas are at the epicentre of the challenges posed by climate change and resource limitation. On the one hand, they are the great consumers of resources as they serve an increasing proportion of the world's population growth. On the other hand, their density and the co-location of infrastructure enables synergies between resource management processes, where outputs of one process become inputs to another. Thus, applying industrial ecology to the urban scale [@Frosch1989] can help to answer the widespread call to move from linear to circular resource consumption patterns [@Leduc2013].

If resource consumption patterns are to be changed, we must give consideration to the processes that manage those resources. Thus here we identify the resource conversion, storage and transport processes and technologies that are likely to shape the metabolism of cities between now and 2030. We conduct a systematic literature review to identify the processes and then categorise them according to the following fields: 

- *Recipe.* This is the relative input and output flows of energy, water and waste resources for the process.
- *Engineering behaviour.* [JK elaborate]
- *City type.* Are the processes applicable to developing areas and/or mature cities?
- *Management.* Are they supply-side or demand-side technologies?
- *Scale.* Urban, district or household?

We gather the findings into a database, and estimate the impacts that each technology would have on metabolic flows of energy, water and waste.  The goal is to identify the most promising technologies and processes for particular city types. This knowledge can be used by planners and policy makers to supply data inputs and mathematical formulations into models to assist in design and decision making.
